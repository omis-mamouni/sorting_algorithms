# C Team Project - Sorting Algorithms

In This project we will learn about the sorting algorithms, the stable ones, the Big O notation and the way of evaluating the time complexity of an algorithm and also the way to select the best sorting algorithm.

For this project we  are given the following print_array, and print_list functions

# Mandatory Tasks


| Tasks|  Descreption
| 0-bubble_sort.c | A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm | 
| 1-insertion_sort_list.c | A function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm |
| 2-selection_sort.c | A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm |
| 3-quick_sort.c | A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm |
